# Extended-Code-Smell-Visualizer
This is a Java program that can detect 18 different types of code smells from source code written in Java.



The main idea is to enhance the Java tool named as “Code Smell Visualizer” to “Extended Code Smell Visualizer” 
 CSV already can identify 15 bad smells in the code 
In Extended CSV, three more  code smells will added (Shotgun Surgery, Brain Method, and Divergent Change)

Methodology:
Metric Based/Threshold Values
Java Tool
AST parser (Abstract Syntax Tree)
